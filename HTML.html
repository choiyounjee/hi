<h1> HTML이란 무엇인가?</h1>
Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the
standard markup language for <strong>creating <u>web</u>
  pages</strong> and web applications.
Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or 
from local storage
and render them into multimedia web pages. <br>HTML describes
the structure of a
web page semantically and originally included cues for the
appearance of the document.
<p>HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages.
  With HTML constructs,
images and other objects, such as interactive forms,
may be embedded into the
rendered page.

HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.
